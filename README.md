# PrimeFactorAttack
Educational Game for 4th Grade Math Students written in Java

TODO (add more items or place your name on things you want to do):<br>
1) Replace the blocks (that now are simple colored rectangles) with some more interesting graphic.
    The colors must stand out form the background and the numbers on the blocks must be clearly readable.

2) Add background images to levels past 3.

3) Greatly improve transition screens.

4) Greatly improve bonus level games/add new games (Jarek).

5) Different button styles at different levels.

6) 1 IS NOT A PRIME!!!  A prime number is a natural
   number ***greater than 1*** that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself!

7) Theme shift: Many of the explosions are both nice looking and mathematical. I think
   it would be nice to add "famous mathematicians" theme that ties all the levels together.
    I would like to see a few of the main classic dudes featured
    (i.e. Euclid, Newton, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Euler, Turing, Hypatia, Ada Lovelace, Florence Nightingale)
    but with a greater number of modern
    mathemagicians (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:21st-century_mathematicians).
    For example, the background images could be low contrast bust superimposed on abstract
    landscapes that include symbols and elements of the depicted mathematician's work.
    One level could have 5 or 6 different but related backgrounds so in one game,
    one background is shown
    and in a different game at the same level a different background is shown.

8) Different sound effects or each level. Not sound effects that you find on the web,
   but sounds that you create and record yourself.
